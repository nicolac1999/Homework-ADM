# Homework-ADM

There are the files required for the first homework .
+ PDF file  which contains the submission of each exercise
+ Homework1.py conteins the scripts of each exercise (Problem 1 and 2)

I have completed all the challenge of Problem 2 and 77 challenges of Problem 1.I have find some difficulties with Regex part ,
some exercises give me same test failure so HackerRank did't allow me to finish the ex.
The others ex. were a good review of pyhon command and operators ,I looked the section "discussion" in the exercise were HackerRank returned 
the results in strange format      (e.g. array with spaces between elements).
